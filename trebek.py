              "Do you have an answer?",
              "I don't believe this. Where did you get that magic marker? We frisked you on the way in here.",
              "What a ride it has been, but boy, oh boy, these Discord users did not know the right answers to any of the questions.",
              "Back off. I don't have to take that from you.",
              "That is _awful_.",

They are: `Potent Potables`, `Point to your own head`, `Letters or Numbers`, `Will this hurt if you put it in your mouth`, `An album cover`, `Make any noise`, and finally, `Famous Muppet Frogs`. I should add that the answer to every question in that category is `Kermit`.",

              "Enough. Let's just get this over with. Here are the categories, they are: `Potent Potables`, `Countries Between Mexico and Canada`, `Members of Simon and Garfunkel`, `I Have a Chardonnay` -- you choose this category, you automatically get the points and I get to have a glass of wine -- `Things You Do With a Pencil Sharpener`, `Tie Your Shoe`, and finally, `Toast`.",
              "Better luck to all of you, in the next round. It's time for Discord Jeopardy, let's take a look at the board. And the categories are: `Potent Potables`, `Literature` -- which is just a big word for books -- `Therapists`, `Current U.S. Presidents`, `Show and Tell`, `Household Objects`, and finally, `One-Letter Words`.",

The categories are: `Potent Potables`, `The Pen is Mightier` -- that category is all about quotes from famous authors, so you'll all probably be more comfortable with our next category -- `Shiny Objects`, continuing with `Opposites`, `Things you Shouldn't Put in Your Mouth`, `What Time is It?`, and, finally, `Months That Start With Feb`."
